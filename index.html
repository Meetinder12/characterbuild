    <p class="lb_text">
   Nico Robin is a character in the One Piece series who first appeared in the 114th chapter of the series. She is introduced as an antagonist, but eventually becomes the seventh member of the Straw Hat Pirates crew, captained by Monkey D. Luffy. Robin is an archaeologist who is well-versed in information and affairs, and can produce “Hanahana-no-Fruit,” a devil fruit that can make any part of her body bloom at will. She is known as the 'Devil Child' due to the fact that her mother researched the Blank Era.
